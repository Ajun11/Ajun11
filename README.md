### Hey 👋, I am Jun Liu 😀.

I am a master student of  <a href="https://www.buaa.edu.cn/">Beihang University(CN)</a> and major in control engineering now. I have graduated from Faculty of Robot Science and Engineering, Northeastern University
 (China), at 2023.

😄 I like robot control, motor control and physics! Any questions about my repositories are welcome！
